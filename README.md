#What is Bitwave?

Bitwave was one of the winners of the Million Dollar Bitcoin Hackathon. Bitwave is a Decentralized web browsing application built on top of blockchain technology. (Yes bitcoins are not just “internet money”) Bitwave allows the user to browse a decentralized internet. Version 2 will include tor routing that will allow users and publishers to remain anonymous and secure. Version 3 Includes Distributed trusted computing execution that runs code in a blackbox that is spread out over the network users.

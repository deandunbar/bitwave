Description: 
        
        ruamel.venvgtk
        --------------
        
        This package is intended to be included in e.g. a tox.ini file
        for testing of packages that rely on gtk2.0. under Linux.
        
        gtk is normally already installed on the target machine but not
        available in any virtualenv. Installing with ``pip`` as dependency is
        not possible.
        
        This package, during setup, will setup links to the relevant directories
        (see ``main()`` in ``setup.py``).
        
        Typical use is to include the following dependency in your ``tox.ini`` file::
        
          deps:
              pytest
              ruamel.venvgtk
        
        or you can install the links to gtk in your virtualenv by activating your
        environment and doing::
        
          pip install ruamel.venvgtk
        
        
        **You don't need to import from this package. Everything interesting
        happens during installation!**
